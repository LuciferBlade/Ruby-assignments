### assignment 3
Fix syntax of assignment 2 ruby code

### assignment 4
Make unit tests for assignment 3 ruby code. Some ruby files were rewritten into object oriented code, they end with "...\_re.rb", test classes start with "tc\_...".

### assignment 5
Too lazy to do description...

### assignment 6 and project
Because of difficulties with github (reference refs/heads/master not found error) project is added as an archive.

**Project idea**
Application extends assignment 5 by adding login, register, logout functionality (authentication); allows to create new, edit or delete existing valuable items; and also keeps previous functionality, like generating random number, showing one of few images and so on.
**Database structure**
Database contains tables for users, items and statuses (statuses are separated mostly to have more fun creating drop box input fields and forms). users table contains {id, email, name and passord_digest} fields; items table has fields for {id, name, value, date, status_id and locations}; status table has only {id, status_name} fields. Whole database file is uploaded as itemCatalogue2.sql file.

**Application preview and functionality**
